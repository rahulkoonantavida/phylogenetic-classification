Building Models for Phylogenetic Classification using Species Codon Usage Frequencies (CMPE252 Final Project)

• Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/577/codon+usage

• Explored the capabilities of utilizing organismal data (codon usage frequencies) to build effective machine
learning models that are able to classify organisms based on their particular phylogenetic kingdom

• Conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dataset dimensionality and utilized sklearn to
construct various models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), achieving up to 95% classification accuracy
